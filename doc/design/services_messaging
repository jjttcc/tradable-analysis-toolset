                   Specs for Messaging/Publishing/Subscribing


APPLICATION-LEVEL

exchange/EOD monitor:

  o Will publish to the EOD_CHECK_CHANNEL channel.
  o Data published:
    - <eod_check_key>
  o Messaging output:
    - sent periodically:
      * current "next upcoming exchange-close time"
      * list of currently open exchanges, with key: "exchange-open-exchanges"
    - sent when the closing-time for a set of exchanges is reached:
      * <symbol-list>: list of symbols, associated with <eod_check_key>, that
        are being "tracked" and that are associated with one of the current
        "recently-closed" (i.e., market-close time just occurred) exchanges.
      * <close-date>: the 'date' (UTC) part of the closing-time that just
        occurred, associated with a key based on <eod_check_key>.
    - the current <eod_check_key> - added (enqueued to the "eod_check_queue".
      (The purpose of the queue is to allow services consuming the published
      symbols to keep track of which keys to look for for a pending symbol
      list - e.g., to allow reliable recovery from a system crash.)

end-of-day data-retrieval:

  o Will subscribe to the EOD_CHECK_CHANNEL channel.
  o Will publish to the EOD_DATA_CHANNEL channel.
  o Data received via subscription:
    - <eod_check_key>
  o Data published:
    - <data_ready_key>
  o Messaging input (See exchange/EOD monitor -> "Messaging output".):
    - <symbol-list>
    - <close-date>    - Used as the "end-date" for data retrieval.
    - <eod_check_key> - Retrieved from "eod_check_queue" as part of
      recovery from interruption or abnormal termination.
  o Messaging output:
    - list of symbols, associated with <data_ready_key>, for which data have
      been retrieved.
    - the current <data_ready_key> - stored in a list associated with key
      EOD_READY_QUEUE.  (The purpose of the list is to allow services
      consuming the published symbols to keep track of which keys to look for
      for a pending symbol list - e.g., to allow reliable recovery from a
      system crash.)
    - for a "data-retrieval run", one and only one of the following[1]:
      * upon completing an entire "data-retrieval run", a 'completed'
        status-message, associated with a key based on <data_ready_key>.
      * upon running out of time during a "data-retrieval run", a 'timed-out'
        status-message, associated with a key based on <data_ready_key>.

end-of-day event management:

  o Will subscribe to the EOD_DATA_CHANNEL channel.
  o Will publish to the TRIGGERED_EVENTS_CHANNEL channel.
  o Data received via subscription:
    - <data_ready_key> (!!!check!!!)

[1] Client services (such as the service responsible for triggering tradable
analysis) will use this datum to discover when there are no more symbols to
be processed for a particular "end-of-a-day".
