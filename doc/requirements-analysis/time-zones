                             TIMEZONE-RELATED SPECS

Configuration:

Rails will be configured to use the UTC timezone (rails default).  The
date/times and timestamps will always be configured in the database
(postgresql) as 'timestamp without timezone' (again, rails/migration default)
and always assumed to be UTC.

User-side timezone display and conversion:

[TO-BE-SPECIFIED]

Services-side conversion:

The dates and times (in market_schedules and market_close_dates) that depend
on a particular exchange (such as 'nasdaq'), which are stored as values
(string, or - (y, m, d): integer), will be converted when needed
when?: (TO-BE- SPECIFIED]) to a DateTime in the local timezone that is
specified in exchanges.timezone.
