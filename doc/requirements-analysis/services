END-OF-DAY DATA-RETRIEVAL

Which Datasets to Retrieve:

EOD data will only be retrieved for the tradables/symbols that are "in
use", where "in-use", for tradable 't', means:

  o t is used in one or more analysis configurations.
  o [TBE: used in any other way that implies up-to-date EOD data are
    required for t.]

Note that the EOD data-retrieval service will not access the database to
determine which symbols to retrieve data for.  Instead it will obtain the
list of symbols for which data are to be retrieved from the messaging
system.  This list will be supplied by a separate service.
