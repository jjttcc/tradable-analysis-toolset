                         LESS-COMMON ANALYSIS SCENARIOS

[scenarios for analysis that differ with respect to the usual procedure/steps]

One-time analysis configuration - best described via example:
  The following analysis is configured for tradable with symbol 'x':
    If 'x' goes above 150, send a notification.  After this event is
    detected and the notification sent, delete or disable the configuration
    so that it won't trigger any future notifications.
