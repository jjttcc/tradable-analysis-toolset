                                END-OF-DAY DATA

EOD data will only be retrieved for the tradables/symbols that are "in
use", where "in-use", for tradable 't', means:

  - t is used in one or more analysis configurations.
  - [TBE: used in any other way that implies up-to-date EOD data is
    required for t.]
