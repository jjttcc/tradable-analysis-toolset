Concepts:

  - analysis profile [DB]: Set of specs to use for a run; all events for
    a run are tagged/associated with the profile used for the run.
  - analysis run: An event-generation/analysis run that uses a specific
    profile and that produces an analysis report
  - analysis report [DB?]: A structured "report" of the results of a run.
  - notification profile [DB]: a "schedule" <@@define this, please@@> and
    associated analysis profile that results in a (usually?/always?)
    periodic analysis run with run times defined by the "schedule"


Characteristics of the important "Concepts":

  - analysis profile: name; ...
  - analysis run:     profile; user(?); date/time; "subrun"s(?),
    user-notification-method/device; ...
  - analysis report:  profile-name; date/time of run; ...; the report
    (important - or possibly all - compoentns) will be stored in the
    database.

Scenarios:

User creates an analysis profile with the GUI/web-interface.  User chooses
option to run the analysis with that profile and an "analysis report" is
displayed when it completes.  User then chooses option to save that profile
to the database.  (Or the user can make changes to the profile, run another
report, save the profile, or etc.)  When the profile is saved, the user is
also given the option to save the results of any report he runs with that
(now persistent) profile to he database, as well; or he can simply exit the
profile-creation/editing page, or start on another profile, or log out.

It will probably be useful to provide a "streamlined" way of creating a
profile and running analysis with it - for a new user that just wants to
quickly try the system out or an existing user who sometimes wants to just
set up and run some quick analyses to check out something or other.
This might look similar to the current home (e.g.,
"http://10.10.1.22:3000/") screen (with the option to choose a stock and
period-type and hit "view chart" or, below that, to choose a set of stock
symbols and a set of analyzers and start/end dates, then hit "run analysis".
But period-type will probably also need to be added - for each analyzer.
Maybe on first use a "default profile", with default values, will be used
for this page and the user can (right away or later) edit this profile,
or, if she has created and saved one or more profiles at this point, choose
one of those profiles to use for this screen.

User (from the appropriate web page/URL) chooses one (or more) of his
analysis profiles to edit, changes start-/end-dates, adds and remove
event generators, and chooses 0 or more event generators to edit -
for generator g do 0 or more of:
  - Change the period type of g.
  - Change the value of one or more of g's parameters.


User deletes one or more analysis profiles.

User creates a "notification profile" (is there a better name?), which
consists of:
  - an analysis profile (selected by name?)
  - the schedule by which the profile will be run - perhaps a one-time run
    will be possible (e.g., run this profile next Monday at 16:30 Eastern
    Time), but usually the schedule will result in a periodic run - e.g.,
    "run this profile every trading day at 16:30", or "run this profile
    every hour during regular market hours on trading days".
  - The methods/media (often just one, but can be several) the user has
    specified to be notified of resulting events.

A scheduled analysis run occurs for user X, which results in an email (or
text, push notification, database update, ... - according to what the user
specified in her notification profile) sent to user X with a formatted
report of each event generated during the run.

=============================================================================

Components, or subcomponents of entities, classes, etc. that are implied
by the above concepts:


analysis profile:

profile name
start-date[1]
end-date (which will often be "now")
analyzer set (i.e., sub-profile for each analyzer chosen)


analyzer profile (each member of "analyzer set"):

evgen-id (AKA event-id or event-generator-id)
evgen name
period-type
parameter settings

Other ideas to be developed or discarded:
  - The user will have the option to specify (in the "notification profile"
    or perhaps the "analysis profile") that all generated events be stored
    in the database and whether or not, for any run, any event that is
    identical (same even-type, date, ...) to one stored in the database
    will be discarded.  This is to allow the user, if she wishes, to not be
    notified of such duplicate events.
  - Optionally, display trading events on the stock/commodity chart.

NOTES

[1] The same start- and end-dates will need to be used for all analyzers in
an analysis profile, since that's how the event-data request is structured.
If the user desires more flexibility - e.g., a different start- and
end-date for each analyzer in the "analyzer set" -, this might lead to
something more complex, such as the modeling profiles with the composite
pattern - e.g., the "analysis profile" above would become an "atomic
profile", supplemented with something like: "abstract profile" and
"composite profile".

[new ideas to incorporate as of Mon Jun 11 22:08:32 CDT 2018]

classes or entities or whatever - i.e., likely will end up in database:

notification profile:

  - schedule
  - analysis-profile
  - notification-recipients (list)

analysis profile:

  - name
  - event-generation-profiles (list)

event-generation-profile:

  - event-generation-specifications (list)
  - end-date (often "now")
  - period-length (determines start date)

event-generation-specification:

  - event-generation-id
  - period-type
  - parameter-specifications (list)

parameter-specification:

  - parameter-id (or name?)
  - value


notification-recipient:

  - notification-media-specifications (list)


notification-media-specification:

  - medium        (e.g., email, text, ...)
  - recipient-id  (e.g., recip@users.org when medium is 'email')


An analysis-profile has 0 or more event-generation-profiles.
Each of those event-generation-profiles has a set of
event-generation-specifications and an end-date and period-length,
so that the same start/end-date/time will be applied to each
event-generator specified in event-generation-specifications.
The event-generation-specification ids a specific event-generator and
includes the parameter settings (parameter-specifications) to use for that
event-generator.

Thus a scheduled (or ad-hoc) analysis run will use one analysis profile,
which will run a set of analyses, each of which has a start- and
end-date/time and will use one or more event-generators.
