{ Tue Jul 31 15:08:50 CDT 2018:
today's plan:
create migration for TradableProcessorParameter.
create model: TradableProcessorSpecification.
}
event-generation and related to-do list (not currently prioritized)

  - period-type specs are likely obsolete - if so, remove it/them.
  - Look into whether we need a "date_map" (or something like that)
    attribute/association for PeriodicTrigger.  (See event-generation-notes.)
  - Flesh out more details of the triggering of analysis runs.
  - TradableObjectFactory [modify, incorporate]
  - AnalysisEvent (probably: new model) [1]
  - TradableProcessor: remove it (removed table, need to
    remove model *.rb file.)
  - [Study code to refresh memory re. relevant detailed design.]
  - MasMonitor is likely obsolete (currently low priority)
  - Figure out when to go back to the main workspace (
    .../tradable-analysis-toolset).

Other (possibly important) "to-do"s (Put this in a separate file):

Check if the 'sessions' database table is used and how it's used.  If it's
not used (and likely never will be), remove it.

[1] Perhaps use TestTradableEvent as a guide, including (possibly)
inheriting from (er, "including") TradableEventInterface.

=====================================================================
Near-future "to-do"s

TradableIndicator model/table probably needs to be created and will have
  <TradableProcessorParameter>s.
After getting back to the main/real workspace, add the 'web-console' gem to the
  gem file and stick '<%= console %>' in index.html.erb.  (See page 53 of
  "Ruby on Rails 5.0 for ...".)

=====================================================================
Completed

  - differences between current TradableProcessorParameter and the
    new model.
  - Add association: User has-many AnalysisSchedule (including, in User -
    add has_many analysis_profiles, and, for AnalysisSchedule model
    generation, user:references)
  - TradableProcessorSpecification [new]
