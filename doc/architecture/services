Triggering Service

PURPOSE: Responsible for "pulling the trigger", based on external (or
periodic/time-based?) events, which sets in action any configured
processing of the data associated with the event.  "Pulling the trigger"
consists of finding the appropriate "trigger" object(s) and "activating" it
(them).  Service X will then be responsible for "seeing" (or "feeling")
the trigger and, as a result, "firing the gun" (i.e., invoking the
resulting analysis).  A very typical example is: "EOD_US_stocks" (end-of-day
data for US stocks) becomes available[1].  The service then queries the
database to obtain the EventBasedTrigger(s) whose 'triggered_event_type' ==
EOD_US_stocks.  If the EventBasedTrigger(s) objects are in a state in which
they can be 'activated' (probably: status == available [possibly: or: status ==
closed] and not activated), "claim" them (status -> busy), set 'activated' to
true, and save the objects (& close the transaction).  And then immediately
"publish an announcement" that a "trigger has been pulled".  (If status is
'busy', someone else is using it [might be "impossible"]; if status is
'not_in_use', it has been disabled (e.g., by the "powers that be") and
should not be touched.)
STIMULUS: External events


Trigger-response Service (Do we need a better name?)

PURPOSE: Responsible for "firing the gun" - i.e., invoking the analysis
implied by whatever event (with associated configuration) triggered the
firing, as well as "collecting and disposing of the body" (i.e., obtaining
the analysis results and storing them in the appropriate places in the
database).  If the "bullet" "misses the target" (i.e., an error occurs that
causes the analysis to fail), appropriate "contingency actions" are
performed (e.g., log the error, ask another service to try to fix the
problem [or just wait for it to be fixed], and, if it looks like it might
"now" be fixed, try again).  When (if) the trigger response has been
successfully completed ("the body has been collected and disposed of"),
"publish an announcement" that an analysis process (a "shooting") has been
completed successfully.
STIMULUS: Reception of an announcement/message to which the service has
subscribed - i.e., a message that a trigger the service is interested in
has been "pulled".


Post-analysis Service (Do we need a better name? [Notification Service?])

PURPOSE: (To-do: Examine the test code to glean/obtain-ideas-about what
actions to perform and what "STIMULUS:" will trigger the post-analysis
service.)
STIMULUS: Reception of an announcement/message to which the service has
subscribed - i.e., a message that an analysis the service is interested in
has been completed.



[1] Implied here is that the triggering service is responsible for invoking
some kind of magic (e.g., waiting for market closing time and then polling
the data provider every <n> minutes until it finds that data for the
current day is available) in which it figures out when the data is
available and, only then, "pulling the trigger".
