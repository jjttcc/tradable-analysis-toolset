Services[1] required by the TAT system:

  - Send configured analysis requests to the MAS server and record the
    results.
  - Obtain the latest analysis results (i.e., any results that have not yet
    been processed) and execute all configured post-processing actions on
    the results.  A main component of this post-processing, obviously, is
    sending out notifications.
  - Cleanup required after post-processing, such as deleting expired data.

[1] These services can be called "background" services, in the sense that
each service is managed by a process that runs in the background.  They are
not invoked directly by the TAT web application.
